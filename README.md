# weather-app
This is a weather app I built in VS - Code using Java and Java Swing GUI, I followed a tutorial by TapTap in order to learn about the inner machinations of Java Swing and learning about GUI's and their functions. It was an amazing learning opportunity for me and I can't wait to use the skills I learned in future projects!
